"""
This module contains functions and types necessary for performing
nonadiabatic molecular dynamics.

Dynamics is performed using [`DifferentialEquations.jl`](https://diffeq.sciml.ai/stable/).
As such, this module is centered around the implementation of the functions
necessary to integrate the dynamics.

For deterministic Hamiltonian methods, the central function is [`Dynamics.motion!`](@ref),
which is the inplace form of the function
to be integrated by [`DifferentialEquations.jl`](https://diffeq.sciml.ai/stable/).

For stochastic methods, `motion!` provides the deterministic part of the equation,
and `random_force!` should be implemented to provide the stochastic part.

Further, methods that have discontinuities, such as surface hopping, use the
[callback interface](https://diffeq.sciml.ai/stable/features/callback_functions/#callbacks)
provided by `DifferentialEquations.jl`.

As per `DifferentialEquations.jl`, this function is implemented for
each method and defines the time derivatives of the `DynamicalVariables`.

We require that each implementation ensures `du` and `u` are subtypes
of `DynamicalVariables` and `sim` subtypes `AbstractSimulation`.
